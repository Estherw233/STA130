    "The chatbot was very effective in both explaining the logic of the code and recognizing errors. Interacting with the chatbot provided me with clear explanations for recognizing Monty Hall problems. While chatbots are convenient, more access to information can provide us with more credible answers. My understanding of AI-driven tools has changed; asking questions is often more efficient than searching when I'm thinking of specific questions for particular examples.Chatbots have certainly saved me long hours of searching when I'm embracing new knowledge. After enjoying the convenience of Chatbot, I find them to be an integral part of learning coding, statistics, and data science, as they make complex topics easier to understand and more efficient to work with.\n",

Overall, AI tools have proven to be crucial in enhancing my understanding and effectiveness of coding, statistics, and data science.\n",
